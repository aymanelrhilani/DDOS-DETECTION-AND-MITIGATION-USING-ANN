to test the model use DDOSTESTDATA.csv ,this dataset is new for the model just put it in the input variable and see the results .
exemple :
1-pick a value from it : like this one --> 17,20581,2,2,50.0,82.0,25.0,25.0,25.0,0.0,41.0,41.0,41.0,0.0,6413.682522715126,194.3540158398523,6860.3335,11876.384,20574.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,0.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,0.0,3.0,3.0,0,0,0,0,40,40,97.17701,97.17701,25.0,41.0,31.4,8.763561,76.8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,39.25,25.0,41.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,50,2,82,-1,-1,1,20,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
2-put it in the predictive model and see the result 
3-if it is a ddos attack it will tell you if it's not it will tell that's not a ddos attack .
